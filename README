**PROJECT ABSTRACT**
This project focuses on optimizing flight routes through analysis and visualization of airline data. The dataset used contains information on the top 1000 US airline route segments by volume in 2015. The data cleaning process involves splitting combined columns, removing redundant information, and updating city names. Geographical coordinates for origin and destination cities are obtained using the Nominatim geocoding service.
The analysis includes visualizations using various libraries such as Matplotlib, Folium, Bokeh, and Cartopy. Matplotlib and Cartopy are used to plot flight routes within the United States on a map, providing a geographical perspective of the routes. Folium is employed to create an interactive map with markers representing origin cities and the total number of passengers. Bokeh is utilized for visualizing airport locations on a Mercator projection map, enhancing the understanding of the spatial distribution of airports.

Additionally, route optimization is facilitated by calculating distances between origin and destination airports using the Haversine formula. The top most popular routes are determined based on the total number of passengers and passenger miles, and visualized using bar charts. These visualizations aid in identifying key routes and understanding passenger distribution, which can inform decision-making processes for route planning and optimization in the airline industry.
